 There are many questions that needs to be answered before diving into programming,
                like....
                       1. what is a program?
                       2. How is a program executed? (ans is for Java program explicitly)
                       3. what are all the components that are involved in execution of a program?

  let's answer these questions one by one.

  1. Program :
       A program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed.
       A program is written by  a computer programmer in a programming language.

  2. How is a program executed?
       In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files, they are compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler,
       which the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) then executes at runtime. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with as .class file.
       When the program is to be run, the bytecode is converted, using the just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
       The result is machine code which is then fed to the memory and is executed.

       Java code needs to be compiled twice in order to be executed:
         i) Java programs need to be compiled to bytecode. (Compile time)
         ii) When the bytecode is run, it needs to be converted to machine code. (Run time).

  3. what are all components that are involved in execution of a program?

       i)   Processor
       ii)  RAM
       iii) Hard disk
       iV)  System Architecture
       V)   GPU
